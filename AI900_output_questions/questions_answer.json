These systems should be able to operate as they were originally designed, respond safely to unanticipated conditions, and resist harmful manipulation. Box 2: Accountability - The people who design and deploy AI systems must be accountable for how their systems operate. Organizations should draw upon industry standards to develop accountability norms. These norms can ensure that AI systems are not the final authority on any decision that impacts people's lives and that humans maintain meaningful control over otherwise highly autonomous AI systems. Box 3: Privacy and security - As AI becomes more prevalent, protecting privacy and securing important personal and business information is becoming more critical and complex. With AI, privacy and data security issues require especially close attention because access to data is essential for AI systems to make accurate and informed predictions and decisions about people.

Personal needs to be secured, and it should be accessed in a way that doesn't compromise an individual's privacy.

Box 2: Feature engineering - Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge of the data to create features that help ML algorithms learn better. In Azure Machine Learning, scaling and normalization techniques are applied to facilitate feature engineering. Collectively, these techniques and feature engineering are referred to as featurization. Note: Often, features are created from raw data through a process of feature engineering. For example, a time stamp in itself might not be useful for modeling until the information is transformed into units of days, months, or categories that are relevant to the problem, such as holiday versus working day. Box 3: Feature selection - In machine learning and statistics, feature selection is the process of selecting a subset of relevant, useful features to use in building an analytical model. Feature selection helps narrow the field of data to the most valuable inputs. Narrowing the field of data helps reduce noise and improve training performance.

The service iterates through ML algorithms paired with feature selections, where each iteration produces a model with a training score. The higher the score, the better the model is considered to \"fit\" your data. It will stop once it hits the exit criteria defined in the experiment.

Linear regression attempts to establish a linear relationship between one or more independent variables and a numeric outcome, or dependent variable. You use this module to define a linear regression method, and then train a model using a labeled dataset. The trained model can then be used to make predictions. Incorrect Answers: ‚úë Classification is a machine learning method that uses data to determine the category, type, or class of an item or row of data. ‚úë Clustering, in machine learning, is a method of grouping data points into similar clusters. It is also called segmentation. Over the years, many clustering algorithms have been developed. Almost all clustering algorithms use the features of individual items to find similar items. For example, you might apply clustering to find similar people by demographics. You might use clustering with text analysis to group sentences with similar topics or sentiment.

You can choose multiple columns, but you must use the same replacement method in all selected columns. Example: Box 2: Split data - Splitting data is a common task in machine learning. You will split your data into two separate datasets. One dataset will train the model and the other will test how well the model performed. Box 3: Linear regression - Because you want to predict price, which is a number, you can use a regression algorithm. For this example, you use a linear regression model.

Linear regression attempts to establish a linear relationship between one or more independent variables and a numeric outcome, or dependent variable. You use this module to define a linear regression method, and then train a model using a labeled dataset. The trained model can then be used to make predictions. Box 2: Clustering - Clustering, in machine learning, is a method of grouping data points into similar clusters. It is also called segmentation. Over the years, many clustering algorithms have been developed. Almost all clustering algorithms use the features of individual items to find similar items. For example, you might apply clustering to find similar people by demographics. You might use clustering with text analysis to group sentences with similar topics or sentiment. Box 3: Classification - Two-class classification provides the answer to simple two-choice questions such as Yes/No or True/False.

Ideally the numeric data represents a continuous scale. Box 2: No - K-Means Clustering - Because the K-means algorithm is an unsupervised learning method, a label column is optional. If your data includes a label, you can use the label values to guide selection of the clusters and optimize the model. If your data has no label, the algorithm creates clusters representing possible categories, based solely on the data. Box 3: No - For classification problems, the label column must contain either categorical values or discrete values. Some examples might be a yes/no rating, a disease classification code or name, or an income group. If you pick a noncategorical column, the component will return an error during training.

Box 2: OCR - Box 3: Objection detection - Object detection is similar to tagging, but the API returns the bounding box coordinates (in pixels) for each object found. For example, if an image contains a dog, cat and person, the Detect operation will list those objects together with their coordinates in the image. You can use this functionality to process the relationships between the objects in an image. It also lets you determine whether there are multiple instances of the same tag in an image. The Detect API applies tags based on the objects or living things identified in the image. There is currently no formal relationship between the tagging taxonomy and the object detection taxonomy. At a conceptual level, the Detect API only finds objects and living things, while the Tag API can also include contextual terms like \"indoor\", which can't be localized with bounding boxes.

An image classifier is an AI service that applies labels (which represent classes) to images, according to their visual characteristics. Unlike the Computer Vision service, Custom Vision allows you to specify the labels to apply. Note: The Custom Vision service uses a machine learning algorithm to apply labels to images. You, the developer, must submit groups of images that feature and lack the characteristics in question. You label the images yourself at the time of submission. Then the algorithm trains to this data and calculates its own accuracy by testing itself on those same images. Once the algorithm is trained, you can test, retrain, and eventually use it to classify new images according to the needs of your app. You can also export the model itself for offline use. Incorrect Answers: Computer Vision: Azure's Computer Vision service provides developers with access to advanced algorithms that process images and return information based on the visual features you're interested in. For example, Computer Vision can determine whether an image contains adult content, find specific brands or objects, or find human faces.

Box 2: similarity - The Find Similar operation does face matching between a target face and a set of candidate faces, finding a smaller set of faces that look similar to the target face. This is useful for doing a face search by image. The service supports two working modes, matchPerson and matchFace. The matchPerson mode returns similar faces after filtering for the same person by using the Verify API. The matchFace mode ignores the same-person filter. It returns a list of similar candidate faces that may or may not belong to the same person. Box 3: identification - Face identification can address \"one-to-many\" matching of one face in an image to a set of faces in a secure repository. Match candidates are returned based on how closely their face data matches the query face. This scenario is used in granting building or airport access to a certain group of people or verifying the user of a device.

Does the tweet also provide his current location? ‚úë Were specified products mentioned in complaints or reviews?
