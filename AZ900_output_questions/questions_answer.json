        "answer_image_text": "Suggested Answer: Box 1: No - A PaaS solution does not provide access to the operating system.  The Azure Web Apps service provides an environment for you to host your web applications. Behind the scenes, the web apps are hosted on virtual machines running IIS.  However, you have no direct access to the virtual machine, the operating system or IIS. Box 2: Yes - A PaaS solution that hosts web apps in Azure does provide the ability to scale the platform automatically. This is known as autoscaling.  Behind the scenes, the web apps are hosted on virtual machines running IIS.  Autoscaling means adding more load balanced virtual machines to host the web apps. Box 3: Yes - PaaS provides a framework that developers can build upon to develop or customize cloud-based applications. PaaS development tools can cut the time it takes to code new apps with pre-coded application components built into the platform, such as workflow, directory services, security features, search and so on.

        "answer_image_text": "Suggested Answer: Box 1: Yes - Traditionally, IT expenses have been considered a Capital Expenditure (CapEx). Today, with the move to the cloud and the pay-as-you-go model, organizations have the ability to stretch their budgets and are shifting their IT CapEx costs to Operating Expenditures (OpEx) instead. This flexibility, in accounting terms, is now an option due to the ◊í‚Ç¨as a Service◊í‚Ç¨ model of purchasing software, cloud storage and other IT related resources. Box 2: No - Two virtual machines using the same size could have different disk configurations.  Therefore, the monthly costs could be different. Box 3: Yes - When an Azure virtual machine is stopped, you don't pay for the virtual machine.  However, you do still pay for the storage costs associated to the virtual machine. The most common storage costs are for the disks attached to the virtual machines.  There are also other storage costs associated with a virtual machine such as storage for diagnostic data and virtual machine backups.

        "answer_image_text": "Suggested Answer: When you are implementing a Software as a Service (SaaS) solution, you are responsible for configuring the SaaS solution.  Everything else is managed by the cloud provider. SaaS requires the least amount of management. The cloud provider is responsible for managing everything, and the end user just uses the software. Software as a service (SaaS) allows users to connect to and use cloud-based apps over the Internet. Common examples are email, calendaring and office tools (such as Microsoft Office 365). SaaS provides a complete software solution which you purchase on a pay-as-you-go basis from a cloud service provider. You rent the use of an app for your organization and your users connect to it over the Internet, usually with a web browser. All of the underlying infrastructure, middleware, app software and app data are located in the service provider's data center. The service provider manages the hardware and software and with the appropriate service agreement, will ensure the availability and the security of the app and your data as well.

You could start with a public cloud and then combine that with an on-premise infrastructure to implement a hybrid cloud. Box 2: Yes - A company can extend the capacity of its internal network by using the public cloud.  This is very common.  When you need more capacity, rather than pay out for new on-premises infrastructure, you can configure a cloud environment and connect your on-premises network to the cloud environment by using a VPN. Box 3: No - It is not true that only guest users can access cloud resources.  You can give anyone with an account in Azure Active Directory access to the cloud resources. There are many authentication scenarios but a common one is to replicate your on-premises Active Directory accounts to Azure Active Directory and provide access to the Azure Active Directory accounts.  Another commonly used authentication method is 'Federation' where authentication for access to cloud resources is passed to another authentication provider such as an on-premises Active Directory. https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/overview/what-is-hybrid-cloud-computing/",

For example, a service running on multiple servers can withstand the failure of one of the servers. Box 2: Disaster recovery is the recovery of a service after a failure. For example, restoring a virtual machine from backup after a virtual machine failure. Box 3: Dynamic scalability is the ability for compute resources to be added to a service when the service is under heavy load.  For example, in a virtual machine scale set, additional instances of the virtual machine are added when the existing virtual machines are under heavy load. Box 4: Latency is the time a service to respond to requests.  For example, the time it takes for a web page to be returned from a web server.  Low latency means low response time which means a quicker response.

You could start with a public cloud and then combine that with an on-premise infrastructure to implement a hybrid cloud. Box 2: Yes - A company can extend the computing resources of its internal network by using the public cloud.  This is very common.  When you need more resources, rather than pay out for new on-premises infrastructure, you can configure a cloud environment and connect your on-premises network to the cloud environment by using a VPN. Box 3: No - It is not true that only guest users can access cloud resources.  You can give anyone with an account in Azure Active Directory access to the cloud resources. There are many authentication scenarios but a common one is to replicate your on-premises Active Directory accounts to Azure Active Directory and provide access to the Azure Active Directory accounts.  Another commonly used authentication method is 'Federation' where authentication for access to cloud resources is passed to another authentication provider such as an on-premises Active Directory.

Box 1: No - With the pay-as-go model, you pay for services as you use them.  This is Opex (Operational Expenditure), not CapEx (Captial Expenditure).  CapEx is where you pay for something upfront. For example, buying a new physical server. Box 2: No - Paying for electricity for your own datacenter will be classed as CapEx, not OpEx. Box 3: Yes - Deploying your own datacenter is an example of CapEx.  This is because you need to purchase all the infrastructure upfront before you can use it.

Ideally the numeric data represents a continuous scale. Box 2: No - K-Means Clustering - Because the K-means algorithm is an unsupervised learning method, a label column is optional. If your data includes a label, you can use the label values to guide selection of the clusters and optimize the model. If your data has no label, the algorithm creates clusters representing possible categories, based solely on the data. Box 3: No - For classification problems, the label column must contain either categorical values or discrete values. Some examples might be a yes/no rating, a disease classification code or name, or an income group. If you pick a noncategorical column, the component will return an error during training.

Cloud features such as scalability, high-availability, and multi-tenant capability are included, reducing the amount of coding that developers must do. Box 2: Software as a service (SaaS) allows users to connect to and use cloud-based apps over the Internet. Common examples are email, calendaring, and office tools (such as Microsoft Office 365). SaaS provides a complete software solution that you purchase on a pay-as-you-go basis from a cloud service provider. You rent the use of an app for your organization, and your users connect to it over the Internet, usually with a web browser. All of the underlying infrastructure, middleware, app software, and app data are located in the service provider's data center. The service provider manages the hardware and software, and with the appropriate service agreement, will ensure the availability and the security of the app and your data as well.

The 'minimum' replication option is Locally Redundant Storage (LRS).  With LRS, data is replicated synchronously three times within the primary region. Box 2: No - Data is not backed up automatically to another Azure Data Center although it can be depending on the replication option configured for the account.  Locally Redundant Storage (LRS) is the default which maintains three copies of the data in the data center. Geo-redundant storage (GRS) has cross-regional replication to protect against regional outages. Data is replicated synchronously three times in the primary region, then replicated asynchronously to the secondary region. Box 3: No - The limits are much higher than that. The current storage limit is 2 PB for US and Europe, and 500 TB for all other regions (including the UK) with no limit on the number of files.

Box 2: Yes - Deleting the resource group will remove the resource group as well as all the resources in that resource group.  This can be useful for the management of resources.  For example, a virtual machine has several components (the VM itself, virtual disks, network adapter etc.).  By placing the VM in its own resource group, you can delete the VM along with all its associated components by deleting the resource group. Another example is when creating a test environment.  You could place the entire test environment (Network components, virtual machines etc.) in one resource group.  You can then delete the entire test environment by deleting the resource group. Box 3: Yes - Resources from multiple different regions can be placed in a resource group.  The resource group only contains metadata about the resources it contains.

Azure service health provides a personalized view of the health of the Azure services and regions you're using. This is the best place to look for service impacting communications about outages, planned maintenance activities, and other health advisories because the authenticated Azure Service Health experience knows which services and resources you currently use. To view the health of all other services available in Azure, you would use the Azure Status component of Azure Service Health.  Azure status informs you of service outages in Azure on the Azure Status page. The page is a global view of the health of all Azure services across all Azure regions. Box 2: Yes - The best way to use Service Health is to set up Service Health alerts to notify you via your preferred communication channels when service issues, planned maintenance, or other changes may affect the Azure services and regions you use. Box 3: No - You can use Resource Health to view the health of a virtual machine.  However, you cannot use Resource Health to prevent a service failure affecting the virtual machine. Azure resource health provides information about the health of your individual cloud resources such as a specific virtual machine instance.

        "answer_image_text": "Suggested Answer: Box 1: Azure SQL Database - SQL Server is a relational database service.  Azure SQL Database is a managed SQL Server Database in Azure.  The SQL Server is managed by Microsoft; you just have access to the database. Box 2: Azure SQL Synapse Analytics Azure SQL Synapse Analytics (previously called Data Warehouse) is a cloud-based Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offering from Microsoft. It is a large-scale, distributed, MPP (massively parallel processing) relational database technology in the same class of competitors as Amazon Redshift or Snowflake. Azure SQL Synapse Analytics is an important component of the Modern Data Warehouse multi-platform architecture. Because Azure SQL Synapse Analytics is an MPP system with a shared-nothing architecture across distributions, it is meant for large-scale analytical workloads which can take advantage of parallelism. Box 3: Azure Data Lake Analytics You can process big data jobs in seconds with Azure Data Lake Analytics. You can process petabytes of data for diverse workload categories such as querying, ETL, analytics, machine learning, machine translation, image processing and sentiment analysis by leveraging existing libraries written in .NET languages, R or Python. Box 4: Azure HDInsight. Apache Hadoop was the original open-source framework for distributed processing and analysis of big data sets on clusters. The Hadoop ecosystem includes related software and utilities, including Apache Hive, Apache HBase, Spark, Kafka, and many others.

        "answer_image_text": "Suggested Answer: Box 1: Azure Monitor is used to monitor the health of Azure services. Azure Monitor maximizes the availability and performance of your applications and services by delivering a comprehensive solution for collecting, analyzing, and acting on telemetry from your cloud and on-premises environments. It helps you understand how your applications are performing and proactively identifies issues affecting them and the resources they depend on. Box 2: You can browse available virtual machine images in the Azure Marketplace. Azure Marketplace provides access and information on solutions and services available from Microsoft and their partners. Customers can discover, try, or buy cloud software solutions built on or for Azure. The catalog of 8,000+ listings provides Azure building blocks, such as Virtual Machines (VMs), APIs, Azure apps, Solution Templates and managed applications, SaaS apps, containers, and consulting services. Box 3. Azure Advisor displays security recommendations. Azure Advisor provides you with a consistent, consolidated view of recommendations for all your Azure resources. It integrates with Azure Security Center to bring you security recommendations. You can get security recommendations from the Security tab on the Advisor dashboard. Security Center helps you prevent, detect, and respond to threats with increased visibility into and control over the security of your Azure resources. It periodically analyzes the security state of your Azure resources. When Security Center identifies potential security vulnerabilities, it creates recommendations. The recommendations guide you through the process of configuring the controls you need.

        "answer_image_text": "Suggested Answer: Box 1: Azure SQL Synapse Analytics Azure SQL Synapse Analytics (previously called Data Warehouse) is a cloud-based Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offering from Microsoft. It is a large-scale, distributed, MPP (massively parallel processing) relational database technology in the same class of competitors as Amazon Redshift or Snowflake. Azure SQL Synapse Analytics is an important component of the Modern Data Warehouse multi-platform architecture. Because Azure SQL Synapse Analytics is an MPP system with a shared-nothing architecture across distributions, it is meant for large-scale analytical workloads which can take advantage of parallelism. Box 2: Azure Machine Learning uses past trainings to provide predictions that have high probability. Machine learning is a data science technique that allows computers to use existing data to forecast future behaviors, outcomes, and trends. By using machine learning, computers learn without being explicitly programmed. Forecasts or predictions from machine learning can make apps and devices smarter. For example, when you shop online, machine learning helps recommend other products you might want based on what you've bought. Box 3: Azure Functions provides serverless computing functionalities. Azure Functions is a serverless compute service that lets you run event-triggered code without having to explicitly provision or manage infrastructure. Box 4: IoT Hub (Internet of things Hub) provides data from millions of sensors. IoT Hub is a managed service, hosted in the cloud, that acts as a central message hub for bi-directional communication between your IoT application and the devices it manages. You can use Azure IoT Hub to build IoT solutions with reliable and secure communications between millions of IoT devices and a cloud- hosted solution backend. You can connect virtually any device to IoT Hub.

        "answer_image_text": "Suggested Answer: Box 1: Azure Bot Services provides a digital online assistant that provides speech support. Bots provide an experience that feels less like using a computer and more like dealing with a person - or at least an intelligent robot. They can be used to shift simple, repetitive tasks, such as taking a dinner reservation or gathering profile information, on to automated systems that may no longer require direct human intervention. Users converse with a bot using text, interactive cards, and speech. A bot interaction can be a quick question and answer, or it can be a sophisticated conversation that intelligently provides access to services. Box 2: Azure Machine Learning uses past trainings to provide predictions that have high probability. Machine learning is a data science technique that allows computers to use existing data to forecast future behaviors, outcomes, and trends. By using machine learning, computers learn without being explicitly programmed. Forecasts or predictions from machine learning can make apps and devices smarter. For example, when you shop online, machine learning helps recommend other products you might want based on what you've bought. Box 3: Azure Functions provides serverless computing functionalities. Azure Functions is a serverless compute service that lets you run event-triggered code without having to explicitly provision or manage infrastructure. Box 4: IoT Hub (Internet of things Hub) provides data from millions of sensors. IoT Hub is a managed service, hosted in the cloud, that acts as a central message hub for bi-directional communication between your IoT application and the devices it manages. You can use Azure IoT Hub to build IoT solutions with reliable and secure communications between millions of IoT devices and a cloud- hosted solution backend. You can connect virtually any device to IoT Hub.

Azure Virtual Machines (VM) is one of several types of on-demand, scalable computing resources that Azure offers. Typically, you choose a VM when you need more control over the computing environment than the other choices offer. Box 2: Azure Container Instances provide portable environments for virtualized applications. Containers are becoming the preferred way to package, deploy, and manage cloud applications. Azure Container Instances offers the fastest and simplest way to run a container in Azure, without having to manage any virtual machines and without having to adopt a higher-level service. Containers offer significant startup benefits over virtual machines (VMs). Azure Container Instances can start containers in Azure in seconds, without the need to provision and manage VMs. Box 3: Azure App Service is used to build, deploy and scale web apps. Azure App Service is a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering that lets you create web and mobile apps for any platform or device and connect to data anywhere, in the cloud or on-premises. App Service includes the web and mobile capabilities that were previously delivered separately as Azure Websites and Azure Mobile Services. Box 4: Azure Functions provide a platform for serverless code.

Box 3: No - The question is rather vague as it would depend on the configuration of the host on the Internet. Windows Server does come with a VPN client and it also supports other encryption methods such IPSec encryption or SSL/TLS so it could encrypt the traffic if the Internet host was configured to require or accept the encryption. However, the VM could not encrypt the traffic to an Internet host that is not configured to require the encryption.

Azure Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) is a cloud-based security solution that leverages your on-premises Active Directory signals to identify, detect, and investigate advanced threats, compromised identities, and malicious insider actions directed at your organization. Sensors are software packages you install on your servers to upload information to Azure ATP. Box 2: To enforce MFA based on a condition, you would use Azure Active Directory Identity Protection. Azure AD Identity Protection helps you manage the roll-out of Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) registration by configuring a Conditional Access policy to require MFA registration no matter what modern authentication app you are signing in to.

In this question, we would store the administrative credentials in the Key Vault. With this solution, there is no need to store the administrative credentials as plain text in the deployment scripts. All information stored in the Key Vault is encrypted. Azure Key Vault can be used to Securely store and tightly control access to tokens, passwords, certificates, API keys, and other secrets. Secrets and keys are safeguarded by Azure, using industry-standard algorithms, key lengths, and hardware security modules (HSMs). The HSMs used are Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 140-2 Level 2 validated. Access to a key vault requires proper authentication and authorization before a caller (user or application) can get access. Authentication establishes the identity of the caller, while authorization determines the operations that they are allowed to perform.

A network security group works like a firewall.  You can attach a network security group to a virtual network and/or individual subnets within the virtual network. You can also attach a network security group to a network interface assigned to a virtual machine.  You can use multiple network security groups within a virtual network to restrict traffic between resources such as virtual machines and subnets. You can filter network traffic to and from Azure resources in an Azure virtual network with a network security group. A network security group contains security rules that allow or deny inbound network traffic to, or outbound network traffic from, several types of Azure resources. In this question, we need to add a rule to the network security group to allow the connection to the virtual machine on port 8080.

The Azure Active Directory Connect synchronization services (Azure AD Connect sync) is a main component of Azure AD Connect. It takes care of all the operations that are related to synchronize identity data between your on-premises environment and Azure AD. Box 2: Yes - As described above, third-party cloud services and on-premises Active Directory can be used to access Azure resources.  This is known as 'federation'. Federation is a collection of domains that have established trust. The level of trust may vary, but typically includes authentication and almost always includes authorization. A typical federation might include a number of organizations that have established trust for shared access to a set of resources. Box 3: Yes - Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is a centralized identity provider in the cloud. This is the primary built-in authentication and authorization service to provide secure access to Azure resources.

Box 3: GDPR - GDPR is the General Data Protection Regulations.  This standard was adopted across Europe in May 2018 and replaces the now deprecated Data Protection Directive. The General Data Protection Regulation (EU) (GDPR) is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy in the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA). It also addresses the transfer of personal data outside the EU and EEA areas. The GDPR aims primarily to give control to individuals over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business by unifying the regulation within the EU.

Box 3: Yes - You can create alerts in Azure Monitor. Alerts in Azure Monitor proactively notify you of critical conditions and potentially attempt to take corrective action.

A commonly used example of this is to federate your on- premises Active Directory environment with Azure AD and use this federation for authentication and authorization. Box 2: Yes - As described above, third-party cloud services and on-premises Active Directory can be used to access Azure resources.  This is known as 'federation'. Federation is a collection of domains that have established trust. The level of trust may vary, but typically includes authentication and almost always includes authorization. A typical federation might include a number of organizations that have established trust for shared access to a set of resources. Box 3: Yes - Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is a centralized identity provider in the cloud. This is the primary built-in authentication and authorization service to provide secure access to Azure resources.

The lock applies to everyone, including global administrators.  If you want to delete the resource group, the lock must be removed first. As an administrator, you may need to lock a subscription, resource group, or resource to prevent other users in your organization from accidentally deleting or modifying critical resources. You can set the lock level to CanNotDelete or ReadOnly. In the portal, the locks are called Delete and Read-only respectively. ‚úë CanNotDelete means authorized users can still read and modify a resource, but they can't delete the resource. ReadOnly means authorized users can read a resource, but they can't delete or update the resource. Applying this lock is similar to restricting all authorized users to the permissions granted by the Reader role.

During sign-in, Conditional Access collects signals from the user, makes decisions based on those signals, and then enforces that decision by allowing or denying the access request or challenging for a multifactor authentication response.

Your Azure costs are 'per subscription'. You are charged monthly for all resources in a subscription. Therefore, to use different payment options per department, you will need to create a separate subscription per department.  You can create multiple subscriptions in a single Azure Active Directory tenant. Incorrect Answers: A: A reservation is where you commit to a resource (for example a virtual machine) for one or three years. This gives you a discounted price on the resource for the reservation period.  Reservations do not provide a way to use different payment options per department. C: A resource group is a logical container for Azure resources. You can view the total cost of all the resources in a resource group. However, resource groups do not provide a way to use different payment options per department. D: A container instance is an Azure resource used to run an application.

In this state, you are not charged for the virtual machine itself.  However, you are still charged for the storage costs of the virtual hard disks attached to the virtual machine. If the virtual machine is stopped but not deallocated (this happens if you shut down the virtual machine from the operating system of the virtual machine), the virtual machine is still mounted on the physical server in Azure and you are charged for the virtual machine itself as well as the storage costs.  To ensure that a virtual machine is 'stopped (deallocated)', you need to stop the virtual machine in the Azure portal.

Box 2: Yes - You can convert a free trial subscription to Pay-As-You-Go.  This is common practice for people who wish to continue using the Azure services when the free trial period expires. Box 3: Yes - You can remove the spending limit, but you can't increase or decrease it. The spending limit in Azure prevents spending over your credit amount. All new customers who sign up for an Azure free account or subscription types that include credits over multiple months have the spending limit turned on by default. The spending limit is equal to the amount of credit and it can't be changed. For example, if you signed up for Azure free account, your spending limit is $200 and you can't change it to $500. However, you can remove the spending limit. So, you either have no limit, or you have a limit equal to the amount of credit.

This gives you a discounted price on the resource for the reservation period. Box 2: No - There are other factors that influence the cost of a virtual machine such as the virtual hard disks attached to the virtual machine. You could have multiple virtual machines with the same 'size' (B2S in this case) but with different virtual hard disk configurations. Box 3: Yes - When a virtual machine is stopped (deallocated), the virtual machine is unloaded/dismounted from the physical server in Azure. In this state, you are not charged for the virtual machine itself.  However, you are still charged for the storage costs of the virtual hard disks attached to the virtual machine. If the virtual machine is stopped but not deallocated (this happens if you shut down the virtual machine from the operating system of the virtual machine), the virtual machine is still mounted on the physical server in Azure and you are charged for the virtual machine itself as well as the storage costs.  To ensure that a virtual machine is 'stopped (deallocated)', you need to stop the virtual machine in the Azure portal.
